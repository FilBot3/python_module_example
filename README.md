# Python Module Example module

## Overview

This is an example Python Module for future reference. I am particularly happy
that I am able to place the code under the `src/` directory and allow me to have
multiple Python Modules and Python Packages under a single directory and keep
the parent directory fairly clean.

## How to Install

```bash
python setup.py install

# OR

python setup.py install --user
```

## How to run Tests

```bash
python setup.py test
```
